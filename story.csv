GWStatue,"You're about to climb the statue when you slip and fall. You land on your back and it feels like the wind was just knocked out of you. Alright--maybe that wasn't a good idea. After taking a moment to regain your breath, you just settle for a regular picture on the ground.",independence hall,,,,,Philly6,,,,,
GWStatue1,"Yeah, on second thought, maybe it isn't a good idea to climb such an important statue. It might get you kicked out before you can even get a chance to see the Liberty Bell up close. You settle for a regular picture on the ground.",independence hall,bell,,,,Philly6,,,,,
Philly6,"After taking your picture, you finally go into Independence Hall where you pay for a tour. They eventually take you to the Liberty Bell, but you can see a large crack running through it. You wonder how hard it must've been hit for such a large crack to form. You shudder. At least the guy that broke it is probably dead by now.",independence hall,bell,,,,Philly7,,,,,
Philly7,"After you finish your tour of Independence Hall, the group decides they have time for one more landmark. Unfortunately, the others seem to be split on which statue to go to. Vritti and Yingjia want to see the LOVE statue, but Xing and Andre wish to see the Rocky Statue. You're the tie breaker.
1. LOVE Statue
2. Rocky Statue",sky,love,,,MC,,,LOVE,Rocky,,
LOVE,"You side with Vritti and Yingjia. You want to see the LOVE statue too. You make your way over to Love Park, and you finally spot the large red letters. You're honestly not sure what you expected--it really is just a statue that spells out 'LOVE.'",sky,love,,,,PhillyEnd,,,,,
Rocky,"You side with Xing and Andrew. You want to see the Rocky statue too. You make your way over to the Philadelphia Museum of Art Steps, and you finally spot the metal version of Rocky. You're honestly not sure what you expected--it really is just a statue of the fictional boxer.",sky,love,,,,PhillyEnd,,,,,

Protest2,"You see Joe standing at the patio, sunglasses donned.
1. Don a pair of sunglasses in reciprocation.
2. Loudly air your grievances from a distance.",whitehouse,,,,MC,,,ProtestEnd,Protest3,,
Protest3,"Joe tries to make out what you are saying, but to tell the truth he can't hear much this far away.",whitehouse,,,,,Protest4,,,,,
Protest4,"Still, he tells you nothing can be done because judging from your state of origin, the Republicans are probably against what you are saying.
1. Sigh and go somewhere else.
2. Keep shouting at him.",whitehouse,,,,MC,,,ProtestEnd,Protest5,,
Protest5,You keep shouting while the rest of the crowd gets bored and goes away. You keep shouting so long he capitulates and invites you all to dinner.,whitehouse,,,,,ProtestEnd,,,,,
ProtestEnd,"You eat dinner at the White House. Unfortunately, there is an infant formula shortage, so you can't have your favorite food, but you did get to have some nice tuna, salmon, and spaghetti.",joe,,,,,Monuments,,,,,
Monuments,"Alright, you decide to look at some long dead people instead. First stop: Lincoln Memorial.",lincoln,,,,,Monuments1,,,,,
Monuments1,"There was actually a competing proposal to build a log cabin as his memorial instead, but the plan of enshrining the man in gargantuan marble ended up winning.",lincoln,,,,,Monuments2,,,,,
Monuments2,"As you enter the building, Lincoln's eyes catches yours. He stares from a height a hundred times more imposing than Mr. Green. You feel threatened.
1. Run.",lincoln,,,,,Monuments3,,,,,
Monuments3,"You run straight back to the Washington Monument. The towering obelisk is even more remniscent of the towering figure of Mr. Green.
1. Run.",obelisk,,,,,Monuments4,,,,,

Orlando1,"You've always wanted to go to Disneyworld. Of course, there's a Disneyland in your very own home-state of California, but obviously, they aren't the same. It seems like everybody else is excited to go to Disneyworld too.",disneyday,,,,,Orlando2,,,,,

Orlando3,"Upon paying a ridiculously expensive price for some tickets (which isn't really a problem for you, but really? In this economy?), you finally enter Disneyworld. What ride do you want to go on first?
1. Space Mountain
2. Haunted Mansion
3. It's a Small World ",disneyday,,,,MC,,,SpaceM,HauntedM,SmallW,
SpaceM,"You decide to go on Space Mountain. If you're going to be honest, the flashing lights strained your eyes a little, but either way, you don't get seizures from bright lights and it was fun. What ride do you want to go on next?
1. Haunted Mansion
2. It's a Small World
3. Maybe it's time for lunch",spacemountain,,,,MC,,,HauntedM,SmallW,DisneyLunch,
HauntedM,"You decide to go on the Haunted Mansion. It's not particularly adrenaline-pumping, but you enjoyed the narration and the super-cool set designs and special effects. What ride do you want to go on next?

2. It's a Small World
3. Maybe it's time for lunch",hauntedmansion,,,,MC,,,SpaceM,SmallW,DisneyLunch,
SmallW,"You decide to go on It's a Small World. Well, what did you expect? It's a kiddy ride (but admittedly, you did find the singing dolls a little creepy). What ride do you want to go on next?
1. Space Mountain

3. Maybe it's time for lunch",itsasmallworld,,,,MC,,,SpaceM,HauntedM,DisneyLunch,
DisneyLunch,"You decide it's time for lunch. You are starting to feel a little hungry, especially after waiting in lines all morning. A trip to Disney is never complete without trying a jumbo turkey leg--so that's exactly what you do.",disneylunch,,,,,DisneyLunch1,,,,,
DisneyLunch1,You finish the entire turkey leg by yourself. You're full. Maybe a bit too fu--you throw up in a nearby trash can. Perhaps you should've thought about sharing that turkey leg. You suppose these are the consequences of greed.,disneylunch,,,,,DisneyLunch2,,,,,
DisneyLunch2,"After throwing up, you're a little worse for wear. Are you up to going on more rides?
1. Yes
2. No",disneylunch,,,,MC,,,Ride,Stop,,
Ride,"Although you've just thrown up, you're determined to go on more rides--you can't just waste all that money you spent on tickets. Splash Mountain is suggested, and suddenly you feel a bit more nauseous, but you stomach those feelings and decide to go anyways.",,,,,,Ride1,,,,,
Ride1,"You go on Splash Mountain, and you start feeling a little better right before it's your turn. However, the ride starts moving and suddenly you're nauseous again. You end up throwing up (again) on the ride--all over the stranger sitting next to you. How embarrassing.",,,,,,Ride2,,,,,
Ride2,"The ride concludes to the end, and your friends hastily apologize to the stranger because you're still too busy dry heaving in a nearby trash can. Maybe you shouldn't have gone on Splash Mountain after all.",,,,,,DisneyEnd,,,,,
Stop,"You decide to listen to your body--you still don't feel very well. You sit out on the next few rides. You're a little disappointed that you couldn't go on the rides, but you eventually start feeling better. At least you didn't embarrass yourself by throwing up all over someone, right?",disneybench,,,,,DisneyEnd,,,,,
DisneyEnd,"By now, the sun has set, and in it's place, the moon. There's a fireworks show starting soon, so you and the others rush toward Main Street early to get a good view. Luckily, you land a spot right in front, where there aren't any abnormally tall people to obscure your vision.",disneyfireworks,,,,,Conclusion,,,,,
Conclusion,"The fireworks begin, and you can't help but be in awe of the fantastic showcase. As the light illuminates your face, you reminisce of your summer adventure.
